# FEUP-AI-Project-2: Speaker Accent Recognition
2nd Project on the Artificial Intelligence curricular unit about Supervised Learning on Speaker Accent Recognition.

This project focuses on building a supervised learning model for speaker accent recognition using Python. The [dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/518/speaker+accent+recognition) used contains audio files of single English words read by speakers from six different countries, and the goal is to classify them based on the accent. The features used for classification are the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) extracted from the audio signals. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The final model can be deployed for practical use to predict the accent of a given audio file MFCCs.
